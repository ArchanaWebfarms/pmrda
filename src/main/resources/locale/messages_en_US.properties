It is home to some of the country\u2019s best educational institutions and is aptly called the \u201COxford of the East\u201D. In the last few decades, the automobile industry and the Information Technology Industry have provided immense employment opportunities. For young Indians, Pune is the most popular destination to work and live. For retired and age-olds, it is the most pleasant and peaceful station in the sun-set phase of their lives. Really, Pune offers something to everybody, and this is embodied in the Marathi phrase \u201C\u092A\u0941\u0923\u0947 \u0924\u093F\u0925\u0947 \u0915\u093E\u092F \u0909\u0923\u0947\u201D.

Kms, which is the third largest Metro region in the country after National Capital Region (NCR) and Bengaluru \u2013 Mysuru Metro Corridor. Therefore, it is essential to manage the urban growth and provide for major infrastructure and civic amenities. For this purpose, the State Government of Maharashtra has established the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) in March, 2015.
ceo.body.p3=The PMRDA team is committed to bridge the infrastructure gaps as well as to prepare the Development Plan for the next 40 to 50 years. At the same time, the proposed Pune Ring Road Project as well as the Metro Project would help ease out the traffic and the transportation network in the region. PMRDA is making an endeavour to work in co-ordination with Pune Municipal Corporation, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and Urban Local Bodies for infrastructure development. The views and opinions of industry associations, business forums, citizen groups and academicians are always welcome as it helps to make policy and projects more realistic. Let us work together to make the Pune Metro Region the \u2018Most Liveable\u2019 city in India.
